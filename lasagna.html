                legendary recipe comes from her late grandmother Susan Powell, a globally renowned and award winning chef. The recipe leaves you with a stringy,

                <li>2 packages (8 ounces each) no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>8 ounces (about 2 cups) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray 15 in. x 11 in. pan with vegetable cooking spray.</li>

                <li>In large sauce pan, heat oil on medium heat; add onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 
                    Add garlic and cook an additional 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add the ground beef, oregano,
                    salt and pepper; break up meat into small pieces with spatula. Cook until no longer pink; drain well. Stir in sauce.</li>

                <li>In medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, eggs, basil, salt, pepper and milk; stir until smooth.</li>

                <li>To assemble lasagna, spread a thin layer of sauce mixture over bottom of prepared pan; place 1 layer uncooked lasagna
                    noodles over sauce. Spread on 1/2 of ricotta cheese mixture, 1/3 of mozzarella cheese, 1/3 of sauce; top with uncooked lasagna noodles.
                    Repeat layering one more time. Top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheeses.</li>

                <li>Lightly spray aluminum foil with vegetable pan spray. Cover lasagna tightly with foil, sprayed side down. Bake 1 hour or until 
                    hot and bubbly; remove from oven and let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
